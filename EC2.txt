EC2 Service: It is a Regional Service.
--------------------------------------
	EC2: Elastic Compute Cloud.(nothing but virtual machine)
	--------------------------------------------------------	
		 based on your application or your requirements it will creates the Server.
		 
		 1. EBS(persistance Storage Volume): elastic block storage ===>one EC2 instance attached to multiple EBS but we can't attach multiple EC2 Instances to single EBS.
		----------------------------------------------------------					
							there 2 types of Drives are there in EBS 1. SSD: Solid storage drives  VS  2. HDD : Hard Drives
							
									Cost	 			Speed		Durability			Highest capacity		Energy efficiency
							HDD		Cheaper				Slower		Less durable			10TB				Use more energy
							SSD		More expensive		Faster		More durable			4TB					Use less energy


		 2. EFS(persistance Storage Volume): elastic file system -> It is Infinitly Scalable ( we don't need to define storage)
		-----------------------------------------------------------
																 =====>In this storage system we can attach multiple EC2 servers. 
																 =====> EFS uses the NFS (Network File Sharing) protocall.
																 =====> NFS Port TCP 2049
								Different Storage Class are there in EFS:
									>> Standard Storage -> after creating EFS defaultly consider as Standard
									>> Infrequent Access Storage -> if your not using EFS since 30 days AWS automatically moves to Infrequent class.
									>> Infrequent Access Requests
		    
		 3. Instance store:
		 ------------------
				=> in above 2 cases (EBS and EFS) the Server connceted to Datastorage Via network.
				=> where as in Instance Store the Datastorage attached to EC2 instance directly. if  our EC2 Instance terminate we lose all the data.
				    Ex: this case sutiable for we don't need Datastorage requirement and fast_operations.
					
    				
	Secuirty group: nothing but virtual firewall. this means it will fillter trafic(incoming as well as outgoing)
	NACL===> network access control list
	data_transfer: 2types : 1. statefull - Secuirty group comes under statefull data_transfer. ===> this means we no need to define role for outgoing trafic. we already defined role for incoming trafic so that is applicable for outgoing trafic.
				2. stateless - NACL===> network access control list (we need to define inbound and outbound rules)  

Pricing Modals: 4 types are there:
----------------------------------
1. on demand
2. spot Instances ===> we get 90% discount ( it is a type of biding for free servers). if any cilient requested for on-demand pricing AWS send a pop_up like we will teriminate your instance.
3. savings plans ======> select for long_term consistance Usage. discount depend on no.of instances you taken
4. reserved instances =====>  select for steady state or predictable usage for long time.in this we get Upto 75% discount. difference is " in this AWS reverse a specific Availability zone ( a slot in a partical data_center) 




Instance Type:
--------------

1. General purpose
2. Compute optimized
3. Memory optimized
4. Accelerated computing
5. storage optimized
6. Instance features
7. Measuring Instance performance

# Diff B/w IOPS and Throughput:
	IOPS: input and output per sec ===> small chenks of data is taking and giving 
			relation Between SIZE and IOPS: 1:50 (Ex: size 10, IOPS 10*50=500)
	Throughput: A Bulk of data(how many chenks of data) is moved from Source to Destination.



Types of IP's:
--------------
1. public ip:
2. private ip:
3. Elastic ip:


# How to modify existing_volume in EC2 Instance:
------------------------------------------------
Steps:

1. we need to stop the Instance.

2. create snap_shot (Go to Volumes -> select Create Snap_Shot) ===> this nothing but backup

3. Modify Volume ( Go to Volumes -> from Actions select MODIFY VOLUME -> change the Size)

4. Start Instance


# How add one more EBS (volume) to existing EC2 Instance:
----------------------------------------------------------
steps:

1. First we need create Volume for that
	a. Go to Volume -> click on Create_Volume -> select which type you need ex: SSD

  Note: 1. Before Creating new Volume first check Our EC2 Instance on Which Available Zone (same Region Data center).
	2. we need to create our New Volume also in same Region Data center(Available Zone).
	# If our EC2 Instance in One Region Data_center and Our New Volume in Another Region Data_center so " we can't attach Volume to EC2 Instance".	

2. Go to Volumes -> Select the Volume -> Select the ATTACH VOLUME from Actions (# need specify Instance ID or Name tag of Instance)

3. Making an Amazon EBS volume available for use on Linux/windos/ .

	a. EBS Volume -> Initial we don't have data in EBS Volume. to Use EBS we need to " mounting the EBS to paticular floder in root user "
	
	
# How to create New AMI's (Amazon Machine Image)
------------------------------------------------
1. First we need to stop the Instance >> Than Go to Volumes ( Action -> select Snapshot)

2. >> GO to Elastic Block Store in that select (snapshots) >> from (Actions) select (Create Image) >> create

3. Go to Images (click on AMI'S) >> from (Actions) select (Lanch) >> then continue from "Choose Instance type"

4. If your wish is " users should not use your AMI" for that:
	GO to Images (click on AMI'S) and select your AMI >> from (Actions) select (Deregister) 
	
	
# How to Copy AMI from one region to Another Region:
-----------------------------------------------------





	
# How to copy Snapshort from One Region to Another Region: 
----------------------------------------------------------
1. GO to Snapshorts >> Go to (Actions) and select (copy) >> new window appered select (new Region)
